        <h2 class = "projects">ComboFish:</h2>
        <p>A game I made for class during my freshman year in college. I initially made it using blitz game studio, during my Junior year winter break I took on converting it to Javascript.<br><br>Use the fishing rod to catch as many fish as possible in a row!</p>

        <h2 class = "projects">Memory Allocation with Interference Graph:</h2>
        <p>A college project for my data structure class where I implemented register allocation by using a graph data structure. The algorithm checks if two data nodes exist at the same time by checking if they share an edge (interference). If they do, they will be assigned to different register, if they don't that means that the register is free for each of them and they can be assigned to the same register. Constraint Satisfaction Problem.</p>
